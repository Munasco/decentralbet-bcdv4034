# üéØ POLYMARKET FUND CUSTODY - THE REAL STORY

## üí∞ What Actually Happens When You Bet

### **Step 1: Deposit Phase**
```
Your MetaMask ‚Üí Proxy Wallet (you control) ‚Üí Hold USDC
```
‚úÖ **Safe**: You control your proxy wallet

### **Step 2: Betting Phase** 
```
Proxy Wallet ‚Üí Conditional Tokens Contract ‚Üí USDC locked
                        ‚Üì
Your Proxy Wallet ‚Üê Outcome Tokens (YES/NO)
```
‚ùó **CRITICAL**: Your USDC is now in Conditional Tokens contract

### **Step 3: Trading Phase**
```
Your balance shows:
- USDC: $0 (locked in Conditional Tokens)
- YES tokens: 100 (value fluctuates $50-150)
- NO tokens: 0
```

## üîç **Your Observation is 100% CORRECT**

**YES - money IS sent somewhere after you bet:**
- **From**: Your proxy wallet  
- **To**: Gnosis Conditional Tokens Framework contract
- **Form**: USDC ‚Üí Outcome tokens
- **Custody**: Conditional Tokens contract holds ALL USDC

## üö® **Security Reality Check**

### **What I Said Before (WRONG):**
> "Users don't send funds to Polymarket's contracts"
> "Funds stay in user-controlled proxy contracts"

### **What Actually Happens (CORRECT):**
- ‚ùå USDC leaves your proxy wallet when you bet
- ‚ùå USDC goes into Conditional Tokens Framework 
- ‚ùå ALL user funds are custodied by Conditional Tokens contract
- ‚úÖ You get outcome tokens that fluctuate in value

## ‚öñÔ∏è **The Real Risk Analysis**

### **Conditional Tokens Framework:**
- **Owner**: Gnosis team (originally)
- **Admin Rights**: Depends on implementation
- **Risk**: If framework is compromised, ALL user funds at risk
- **Mitigation**: Framework is battle-tested, audited, open source

### **Polymarket's Role:**
- Creates markets using the framework
- Provides oracle resolution
- Cannot directly steal funds from Conditional Tokens
- But controls market outcomes (indirect control)

## üéØ **Key Insights:**

1. **Proxy wallets don't protect against Conditional Tokens risk**
2. **All USDC goes into one shared framework contract**  
3. **You're trusting Gnosis Conditional Tokens security**
4. **Market resolution is still centralized (Polymarket)**

## üí° **For DecentralBet:**

**Your original concern about fund custody is VALID.**

**Options:**
1. **Accept the risk** - Use Conditional Tokens (like Polymarket)
2. **Build safer** - Use our secured betting pools with timelocks
3. **Hybrid approach** - Start simple, migrate to Conditional Tokens later

**Bottom line**: Even Polymarket users are trusting a shared smart contract system with their funds. The proxy wallet architecture provides SOME protection, but not complete protection.
